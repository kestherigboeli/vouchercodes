### There are several reasons why I use Nightwatch.js for end-to-end testing: ###
* It is easy to set up.
* Nightwatch comes with built-in API, making it easy to interact with web pages and perform common actions.
* Nightwatch supports many browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
* Nightwatch can be integrated with other testing tools, such as Selenium, to provide even more functionality.

### Steps for Testing ###
* install node via npm or yarn
* Clone the repository
* install all dependencies by # npm install
* Enter this code to run the test # > (DATE="2023-02-18" NUMBER=10 nightwatch) < <p>DATE=<Date in format Year,Month, Day exmaple "2023-02-18"> NUMBER=<number between 1 to 10 or 10+> nightwatch </p>
  * DATE="2023-02-18" NUMBER=10 nightwatch
